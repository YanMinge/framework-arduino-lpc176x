## PlatformIO framework for the LPC176x MCU series
This framework is part of the custom [PlatformIO platform](https://github.com/p3p/pio-nxplpc-arduino-lpc176x)
that [MarlinFirmware](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) uses to build for the LPC176x MCU.

The framework aims to eventually be Arduino API compatible, though Arduino libraries will probably not work,
this is a work in progress with most basic functionality available.

### Hardware Serial Ports
| Port | TX | RX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Serial  | P0_02 | P0_03 | 
| Serial1 | P0_15 | P0_16 | 
| Serial2 | P0_10 | P0_11 | 
| Serial3 | P0_00 | P0_01 |  

### AnalogRead
There are 8 ADC channels available `P0_02, P0_03, P0_23, P0_24, P0_25, P0_26, P1_30, P1_31`

### AnalogWrite
Although all pins can be used for PWM (software mode) there are 6 Hardware PWM channels, if a hardware channel is
available for a pin but it is in use by another pin it will fall back into software mode, All channels
software and hardware share a period (default 20ms).

| Hardware channel | Attached pins |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | P1_18, P2_00  |
| 2 | P1_20, P2_01, P3_25 | 
| 3 | P1_21, P2_02, P3_26 | 
| 4 | P1_23, P2_03 | 
| 5 | P1_24, P2_04 | 
| 6 | P1_26, P2_05 |
